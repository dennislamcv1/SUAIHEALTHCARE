    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Identify and analyze class imbalance in medical datasets\n",
    " - Apply Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to handle imbalanced data\n",
    " - Evaluate models using Precision, Recall, and Precision-Recall curves\n",
    " - Describe why accuracy is misleading for rare conditions\n",
    " - Build effective classifiers for detecting rare medical conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you will do in this lab\n",
    "\n",
    "In medical diagnostics, detecting rare conditions presents unique challenges. When a disease affects only 1-2% of patients, traditional machine learning approaches often fail. A model that simply predicts \"healthy\" for everyone would achieve 98-99% accuracy while being completely useless in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab addresses the real-world challenge of building reliable diagnostic tools for rare conditions. You will work with a highly imbalanced medical dataset where malignant cases are significantly less common than benign cases, mirroring actual clinical scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyze a highly imbalanced medical dataset with rare positive cases\n",
    "- Train baseline machine learning models and identify their limitations\n",
    "- Apply Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the training data\n",
    "- Compare model performance using appropriate metrics for imbalanced data\n",
    "- Learn to interpret Precision-Recall curves for clinical decision-making\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Class imbalance is one of the most common challenges in medical machine learning. When positive cases (patients with a condition) represent less than 5% of the dataset, standard classification algorithms become biased toward the majority class. This creates a dangerous situation in medical diagnostics: models may achieve impressive accuracy scores while failing to detect the very cases they were designed to identify.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem stems from how most machine learning algorithms optimize their objective functions. They minimize overall error rate, which in an imbalanced dataset means correctly classifying the abundant negative cases. The algorithm \"learns\" that predicting \"negative\" most of the time yields good performance metrics, even if this strategy misses all positive cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab introduces you to techniques specifically designed for imbalanced classification problems. You will use SMOTE, a sophisticated resampling technique that creates synthetic examples of the minority class by interpolating between existing positive cases. This approach is superior to simple duplication because it helps the model learn the broader decision boundary of the positive class without overfitting to specific examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond resampling techniques, you will learn to evaluate models using metrics appropriate for imbalanced data. Precision-Recall curves, F1-scores, and careful analysis of confusion matrices provide insights that accuracy alone cannot reveal. These evaluation methods help data scientists and medical professionals make informed decisions about model deployment, threshold selection, and the trade-offs between false positives and false negatives in clinical settings."
